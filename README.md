# C-Data-structure
Problem solving with application of various data structures in C++

Using various data structures and rules in C++ to solve problems with memory management, efficiency, and complexity theories in mind. Tasks include creating of own Vector class with link-list and dynamic array, Stack class, Multi-map class, recursions, and Binary search tree. Created a weather sorting program that stores more than 500,000 data from 10 files into a BST and it is stored separately according to their year, more effective than storing all of the data into a single vector. Uses a recursive method to traverse the BST to find retrieve data.
